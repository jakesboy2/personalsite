                            <p style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp&nbspWe hold certain development principles in high regard when it comes to developing our code. Constant <b>refactoring</b>, <b>rethinking</b>, and <b>reimplmenting</b>
                                features in an attempt to make them cleaner, more effective, and less prone to errors is a constant battle that we seek to win.
                            <br><br> &nbsp&nbsp<b>Maintainability</b> is our top priority. After finishing a major feature we come together and discuss what can be improved. Often times, this means abstracting functionality
                            into various design patterns, functions, or classes. Constant discussions and changes are considered and completed to restructure our AI in a way that will make it easier to work with based on 
                            our most common pain-points. 
                            <br><br> &nbsp&nbsp We make use of various <b>design patterns</b> often within our development. There is also a high emphisis on principles meant to reduce coupling and increase coherence.

                                    &nbsp&nbspScreeps is a massive multiplayer online real-time strategy game. Each player can create their own colony in a single persistent world shared by all players.
                                <br><br> &nbsp&nbspUsing the game's provided <a href="https://docs.screeps.com/api/" target="_blank">API</a>, you program your AI in Javascript, Typescript, or any language that compiles into 
                                web assembly.
                                <br><br> &nbsp&nbspYou control every aspect of the game from your code. Every 'tick' (roughly 2.5-3.5 seconds real-time), player's scripts are ran and intents are queued based on the results
                                of your code. Intents include things such as calling a method on an instance of a Spawn object to create a new <a href="https://docs.screeps.com/creeps.html" target="_blank">creep</a>, moving a creep in a particular direction, upgrading your room,
                                attacking another player, harvesting resources, and building or repairing various structures.
                                <br><br> &nbsp&nbspYour code runs even when you are offline. The world is always running. Because of its nature as a sandbox game, there are no win-conditions or goals; however, there is a leaderboard
                                that tracks the amount of energy you have used to upgrade your rooms. Claiming more rooms gives you more opportunity to gain control points, more territory in the world, and more notoriety amoung other players.
                                <br><br> &nbsp&nbspThere is a global market place you can use to trade resources with other players, and various powerful players have come together to create alliances which has resulted in large scale world wars breaking out. <br><br><br>

                    <h3>Strategy Pattern</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p style="padding: 10px">
                        &nbsp&nbsp We make use of this design pattern more than any other in our code-base. This was the result of our first major refactor. The issue 
                       that we were trying to solve was the amount of switch statements whose only purpose was to decide what helper function to call.
                       Eventually, an idea was born. To demonstrate the concept and our application of it, I will use our API function that generates the 
                       spawning limits for each room.
                       <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp For a quick introduction to the context here, we have our room split up into multiple 'Room States' based on conditions being met
                       such as, the amount of energy available, the presence of particular structures, and the presence of option flags. To replace the switch statement that decided how many of 
                       each creep we wanted at each room state, we needed a way to abstract out the entire concept of creep limits and have a file for each room state we want to configure the limits for.

                       <ul style="padding: 10px;" class="list-group">
                           <!-- Interface Step -->
                           <a href="/static/screenshots/interface.png" target="_blank"><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary a-override">
                               <h4><u>Define Interface</u></h4>
                               The first step is to set up an interface to use for generating the spawn limits for the room. This contains the definitions for 
                               generating domestic and remote limits, as well as a property reference to the name of the current room state. This is so we can find it at run-time.
                            </li></a>
                            
                            <!-- Instance Def Step -->
                            <a href="/static/screenshots/instance-def.png" target="_blank"><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-dark a-override">
                                <h4><u>Implementation Set-up</u></h4>
                                We then defined a class that implements the interface from the previous step, for every room state we wanted to use. The only trick here is defining 
                                the name of the current room state as defined in class we are in, and binding the methods to the instance of this object.
                            </li></a>

                            <!-- generate instance Step -->
                            <a href="/static/screenshots/generate-instance.png" target="_blank"><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary a-override">
                                <h4><u>Implementation Meat & Bones</u></h4>
                                This is where we actual set up the specific room state's implementation. For this room state, we create and return the object containing all of the 
                                creep roles we want to define limits for. This same process is done below on the remote limits as well, as they are split into different methods for 
                                maintainability. 
                            </li></a>

                            <!-- Constant array Step -->
                            <a href="/static/screenshots/constant-arr.png" target="_blank"><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-dark a-override">
                                <h4><u>Array of Implementation Instances</u></h4>
                                Here we simply define an array that contains the instance of each of these implementations. This is the array we will use to decide at run-time which instance 
                                we are going to call for each unique situation and state the code can be in at any given time. 
                            </li></a>
                            
                            <!-- generate abstract Step -->

                                <h4><u>Select an Implementation at Run-time</u></h4>
                                For this step, we get the room state of the current room, and loop over the array created in the previous step until we find a match. From there we simply 
                                return the value of that implmentation's method. This allows each room to get its own custom object that defines the spawn limits for itself.
                            </li></a>

                            <!-- Set limits Step -->
                            <a href="/static/screenshots/set-limits.png" target="_blank"><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-dark a-override">
                                <h4><u>Setting the Limits</u></h4>
                                In here, we use our Memory API to update the limits for the room, by passing in the room we are updating, and the object returned from that room's configured limits 
                                for this room state, generated using the above steps. The exception here is generating a military creep queue, because it works off a queue instead of limits; however, remote 
                                and domestic creeps are generated using the strategy pattern as described here. 
                            </li></a>
                       </ul>
                       <hr>
                       <p style="padding: 10px">&nbsp&nbsp These steps are repeated for several modules of our code. Namely, creep roles, creep spawning helpers (options, name, target/home rooms, etc), flag handlers, and spawn limits.
                       This design pattern provides a powerful tool for separating your logic and clearly seeing where each section of each state the room can be in is defined for easy maintainence, reliability,
                       and bug-squashing.</p>

                        The rational behind this pattern involves not wanting to duplicate code. This has two reason: making refactoring and code changes simpler and less prone to bugs, and reducing overall development time.

                                Every creep that needs to get these jobs uses this function. Theres no reason to manually search the array from memory yourself, and if we change how we 
                                want to get the fill jobs, or what we consider a fill job, we can change it here and the changes will reflect on every creep.

                            &nbsp&nbspI can't really think of a way to provide examples and screenshots for this, so the best I can do is provide the rationale behind this principle. 
                            Essentially, I find myself often writing a TODO comment to abstract something into a function, or improve the logic for a situation in an attempt to just get the working product out ASAP.
                            What we attempt to do in this case is simply delete the comment, and do what we were writing the comment for. 
                            <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp There has to be a balance here, you don't want to spend a ton of time going down a rabbit hole on a feature you might not even end up needing because you discover you need to redesign 
                            the feature as you progress through its development. The line lies in making sure you keep up with your TODO comments and issues as you finish features to make sure you don't collect a large 
                            backlog of incomplete features to build your future code off of. 
                            <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp This also supports constant refactoring. We always look for chances to re-evaluate our code and find places to improve. This has resulted in a code base that has been in 
                            development now for over a year and has maintained clean and easy to add features and fix bugs within.

                                <b><i>Gus "Miner" Johnson</i></b><br><br>
                                Before the <i>Great War</i>, Gus spent his days working in the 
                                energy mines with his father and four brothers. After an accident 
                                in the mines, Gus emerged as the sole survivor.
                                With no family, no friends, and nowhere to go, Gus decided to take his 
                                talents to the new lands out west. He didn't know anything about it, 
                                just that his old friends called the foreign lands the 'Screeps', and complained they 
                                were going to put them out of business due to the abundance of energy 
                                sources and migrant workers ready to trade body for coin.
                                Gus teammed up with some fresh migrants he met on the journey over and 
                                together they formed a community focused on surviving out in this new world.

                                The miner creep is the foundation of the room. They sit diligantly on each 
                                energy source within the room and mine energy. They do not carry it, or move it, or place 
                                it anywhere, they simply mine it and allow it to drop below them, where a container 
                                will generally be in place to accept their offering. Without the miner, the room cannot exist.
